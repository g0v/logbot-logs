00:44 < clkao> 寫了人生第一個 google chrome 外掛
00:45 < clkao> 只有七行: https://github.com/g0v/ly-crx/blob/master/src/contentscript.ls

00:45 < tkirby> !
00:45 < tkirby> clkao: 你剛剛說
00:45 < clkao> 我說錯了
00:46 < tkirby> clkao: 你剛說的那個 admin changs 是在?
00:46 < clkao> https://ethercalc.org/g0v-admin-changes
00:46 < kcwu> clkao's url: [EtherCalc - Share the URL to your friends and edit together!]
00:46 < clkao> 有 csv endpoint: https://ethercalc.org/_/g0v-admin-changes/csv
00:47 < tkirby> hmm
00:47 < clkao> au: would it be better to make the csv endpoint give content-disposition with filename <calcid>.csv ?

00:50 < clkao> 雖然只有七行 花了點時間弄 grunt-based scaffold, 順便改用 bower 抓 jquery
00:51 < clkao> ronnywang: 可以參考一下 ^^ 減少 jquery file on github :p
00:52 < clkao> 不過話說回來 gruntfile 真的是蠻囉唆的
01:46 < MindosCheng> 收到 # 話說我用 d3-3x 的 3dmap2 看 twVote 宜蘭會破掉..

02:11 < clkao> wikipedia 真貼心: <span style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted" title="字元描述：左「魚」右「逮」※此字在您的系統上可能無法顯示，因而變成空白、方塊或問號。">𩻸</span>
02:11 < clkao> au: moedict 有類似機制嗎.. ?
02:27 < gugod> 真是高科技的結晶 (?)
02:30 < au> clkao: moe 有 title="⿰魚逮" 但目前只限 Unicode 未收錄字
02:30 < au> 其他用 webfont 做了所以在您的系統上一定可以顯示，不致變成空白、方塊或問號

13:47 -!- ck_ [~ck@111.235.248.37] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
13:47 < clkao> i also wonder why kind of stats/logging we should recommend using along with pgrest
13:47 < clkao> ideally it should store into pgrest and be available via pgrest ;)
