21:57 < clkao_> 收到最小統計區的圖資了
21:57 -!- kanru [~kanru@66.207.208.98] has joined #g0v.tw
22:03 < clkao_> 看起來品質是比較好
22:05 < ronnywang> 最小統計區的單位是什麼?
22:09 < ronnywang> 應該說他的 ID 會長的像什麼樣子?
22:14 < clkao_> ronnywang: A6510-02-001 其中 A6510-02 可對應到 V_ID
22:14 < clkao_> 所以理論上是 就是 V_ID + \d\d\d
22:17 < clkao_> 不過目前有最小統計區資料的好像只有人口相關
22:18 < clkao_> 晚點來試試看合併邊界 眼睛看是比國土測繪中心的邊界好一些
22:21 < clkao_> ronnywang: sorry 說錯了 最小統計區 A6501-0001-00, 一級發布區 A6501-D9-001, 二級發布區 A6501-D9
22:21 < tkirby> dynamic drawing!!
22:21 < clkao_> tkirby: 那個實在太酷了!!
22:21 < tkirby> clkao_: 超酷! 超想要!
22:23 < clkao_> A6XXX 可對應到村里
22:23 < clkao_> 最小區跟 1/2 級是兩套 numbering
22:24 < clkao_> tkirby: 不過其實那個演講好像是一年前的. code 倒是沒看到 ;P
22:24 < clkao_> github 上有兩個不成熟的 clone
22:25 < ronnywang> 喔喔，我來看看
22:25 < tkirby> 唔~ 太可惜
22:30 < tkirby> clkao_: 阿, 不知道 au 有沒有跟你說.. 後來結果是沒有缺, 所以..
22:32 < clkao_> 唔~ 太可惜

22:33 < tkirby> clkao_: 以後有開公司再找我吧, 一定會加盟 >.^
22:33 < ronnywang> clkao_: 所以目前有辦法做到門牌對到最小統計區嗎
22:34 < clkao_> ronnywang: 應該可以 直接看座標 in 哪個 polygon
22:35 < ronnywang> 門牌對座標的部分要用 google geodecode ?
22:37 -!- hychen [~hychen@host-58-114-186-76.dynamic.kbtelecom.net] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
22:39 < clkao_> right. 但圖資看來是 TW97 座標
22:40 < clkao_> 找時間來玩一下 postgis 好了... 也許能和 plv8x 做出什麼怪東西
22:42 < clkao_> tkirby: 要成立科科科比黨了嗎
22:45 < tkirby> clkao_: 科科~
