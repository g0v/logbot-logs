09:45 < clkao> mjhsieh: explore around a bit ;)
09:50 < mjhsieh> clkao: putting the json in the query string + URL is very painful...

10:22 < clkao> want to write a client helper?  there could be something already... this is similar to https://support.mongolab.com/entries/20433053-rest-api-for-mongodb
10:22 < kcwu> clkao's url: [REST API for MongoDB : MongoLab Support]
10:24 < mjhsieh> how about just use mongodb ? XD
10:24 < mjhsieh> s/use mongodb/using mongodb/
10:25  * mjhsieh 常常經過 mongo 門口...
10:25 < cls_bsd> ...
10:29 < clkao> mjhsieh: tried that. not very good for very relational data.  no cheap population of heavily linked data

10:37 < clkao> same thing = storing relational data in mongo or ?
10:37 < opop> clkao: 有人在問天氣的API

10:38 < clkao> 年久失修中
10:38 < clkao> 上禮拜有想要整一下 不過太多事情了
10:38 < opop> 然後他會用在商業用途, 可以付費
