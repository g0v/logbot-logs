17:59 < clkao> au: CTE seems better suited for pgrest acl
18:02 < au> CTE?
18:04 < clkao> WITH... 
18:06 < clkao> still a bit lame: with member_id as (select pgrest_param('member_id')::int as member_id) select * from member_contingent_left where member_contingent_left.member_id = (select member_id from member_id);
18:07 < clkao> this works too though: select * from member_contingent_left where member_contingent_left.member_id = (select pgrest_param('member_id')::int)

22:11 < clkao> au: this feels right: with auth as (select ensure_member() as member_id) select * from member_contingent_left where member_contingent_left.member_id = (select member_id from auth);
22:12 < clkao> ditto for ensure_unit_member(), ensure_initiative_owner()  etc
22:15 < au> "WITH auth AS NULL ..." returns null?
22:15 < au> oh, returns empty row
22:15 < au> *rows. great

23:40 < ipa> 昨天hychen 提到鄉民關心你可以呈現雙方觀點，所以不想做follow功能（容易同類相聚），跟這篇有相似之處
23:41 < ipa> 再用動民主，可以練習如何提方案。
23:42 < clkao> hychen: lfrest 加了神秘的 pgrest auth 功能，可以先看一下，看是否符合需求
23:43 < hychen> clkao, ok
23:44 < clkao> hychen: 基本上先下一次 select pgrest_param('{"member_id": 1}'::json)
23:45 < clkao> hychen: 之後的 view 可以用 pgrest_param('member_id') 作為 constraint. 然後 src 裡面的 helper 可以拿來疊東西... 合用的話 就應該把 pgrest_param 搬到 pgrest core 進去
