15:27 < ronnywang> 地政資料上，同一個 Big5 在不同縣市可能代表不同字 orz
15:40 < clkao> ronnywang: ..... 譬如說.. ?
15:42 < ronnywang> 我也不知道是不是 Big5..不過我從 http://data.gov.tw/opendata/Details?sno=341000000A-00006 這邊抓下來的資料
15:42 < kcwu> ronnywang's url: [政府資料開放平臺>資料分類>服務分類>公共資訊>rawData]
15:46 < clkao> ronnywang: 是地段的名字嗎？可能每個地方地政事務所自己造自己的... zz
15:46 < ronnywang> 其中有個 [地政] 的資料夾，像我遇到一個基隆的東82A1街, 82A1在基隆代表「峯」
15:47 < ronnywang> 在台北市的 82A1 代表琢
15:48 < ronnywang> 在十個縣市有用到 82A1 ，都代表不同的字
15:50 < clkao> 不過真的地政資料中 還是用這些嗎？也許只是 legacy info
15:52 < kcwu> 不知道這種事隨著 data.gov.tw 資料愈來愈多, 是不是常常碰到
15:52 < kcwu> 也許要做一個 單位:big5->unicode 的 table ....orz
15:53 < clkao> big5 外字有對應到 pua 的規則嗎? 感覺應該是 單位:pua mapping 比較 generic. 日本好像也遇到一樣的問題
15:55 < kcwu> big5 有 pua range
15:57 < clkao> 嗯，主要是一般轉換工具有通用的對應嗎？
15:58 < clkao> 原來萬碼奔騰的時代又回來了
