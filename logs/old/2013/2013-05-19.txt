00:03 < au> https://ethercalc.org/g0v-hackath3n looks ok here though
00:03 < kcwu> au's url: [EtherCalc - Share the URL to your friends and edit together!]
00:03 < clkao> but do you see error?  csv load fails ~30% of the time
00:03 < au> no... consistently works
00:03 < au> weird
00:04 < au> I have a cron monitoring csv loading
00:05 < au> "curl https://ethercalc.org/g0v-hackath3n.csv" works on other hosts too
00:05 < au> does restart browser help?
00:07 < clkao> au: https://ethercalc.org/_/jsdctw2013/csv is returning two different versions of csv upon each load
00:08 < clkao> once with 非官方懶人包 and once without
00:09 < au> fixed
00:09 < clkao> it seems consistent now
00:10 < tkirby> clkao: !!!
00:10 < clkao> what's causing this?  temporal distortion caused by some tetrion emissions ?
00:11 < au> no... socket.io + redis horizontal scaling fubar
