23:00 < mindos> clkao: topojson 我想是 d3.geo 改版的問題。研究中。
23:03 < clkao> mindos: hmm 我搞錯, 我改的是 3dmap, 不是 topojson... 也許可以看看我改的方式.. ? 不過修理 topojson 好像在 kirby 的 todo list 上 :p
23:03 < clkao> also note topojson v1 api change
23:05 < mindos> clkao: got it :) 頭都洗一半了，就將錯就錯了......
23:05 < clkao> 順便完食一下 d3
23:05 < clkao> |D
23:12 < mindos> 3dmap2 有修好 不過 3dmap3 沒有
23:12 < mindos> 我修一下
23:21  * au 正在考慮拿萌典投 COSCUP g0v.tw track (可能要淡化 PgREST 技術部份)
23:22 < clkao> au++
23:22 < clkao> 話說一回來發現.... 台灣網路好慢

23:35 < clkao> 只好請出王牌 hcchien ? XD
23:35 < mindos> 喔喔~~~
23:35 < mindos> 神主
23:44 < mindos> 為什麼要開 gh-pages-d3-3x 這個 branch 呢
23:45 < mindos> clkao: 我猜 kirby 是要改 3dmap 成 topojson 我是在改 topojson.html 
23:47  * tkirby 遭到 highlight
23:50 < tkirby> 我來投個... "d3js 在開放資料的應用 - 以 g0v 為例" 如何
23:50 < tkirby> 話說 g0v 可以有多少議程
23:51 < au> 似乎無上限
23:52 < mindos> tkirby : 上次 opop 說是先投，最後會傳到社團審。
23:52 < mindos> 所以我們就無上限投，對吧
23:53 < mindos> COSCUP 聽說有八個 thread....
23:53 < tkirby> hmm
23:53 < tkirby> XD
23:53 < mindos> tkirby : 我想看上次的 d3 slide !
