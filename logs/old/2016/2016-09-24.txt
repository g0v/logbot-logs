02:35 < g0vtelegrambot> <ninabreznik> Hello, I apologise in advance for asking not relevant question, but I still hope you could help me :) Together with @serapath we plan to visit Taiwan for 2 months from mid October and need to find some affordable apartment (open source & social developers with little income at the moment). Any tips? And some links to meetups to meet you?

02:55 < g0vtelegrambot> <ninabreznik> Hehe, @jjjenq reminded me that it would be smart to say which city :) Taipei. I assume most of you are there, right?

21:33 < slackbot1> <kiang> 想請問有人用過比較好的 diff 輸出工具嗎？一般 diff 會以行作為異動基礎， 立委投票指南的可以縮小到字的增減( <http://vote.ly.g0v.tw/bill/0024150/> ) ，最理想的是像 Meld ( <http://meldmerge.org/> )這樣的輸出，只是 Meld 只能在軟體開啟，希望能夠輸出網頁格式
