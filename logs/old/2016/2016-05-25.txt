13:47 < slackbot2> <fumi> 昨天在新莊運動公園路上遇到hychen穿著2014summit的黑色衣服路上走，攀談一下。第一次在路上遇到g0v的人，內心好激動。

20:25 < slackbot2> <lizbarry> hey @clkao how did the dual audio turn out on the YouTube videos? You mentioned using the Left channel for one language, and the R channel for another -- did it work?
20:49 < slackbot2> <clkao> lizbarry: i think so, you need to ask yutin and others.  but thatr’s only for the livestream. processed video clips have the original soundtrack only
20:52 < slackbot2> <lizbarry> Ooooh. Did the livestreams get recorded? This idea is kind of interesting, I want to check it out and possibly promote it

21:53 < slackbot2> <clkao> lizbarry: it’s there but not published, because we didn’t get audio release signed from the interpreters
21:59 < slackbot2> <lizbarry> Ohhhhhhhhhh. Ok. 
22:07 < slackbot2> <lizbarry> Other question: on the stickers, what does "Dig" mean?

22:56 < slackbot2> <kiang> @lizbarry: maybe it means "dig a hole". We usually call a g0v project as a hole. And the guy who created 
22:59 < slackbot2> <kiang> @lizbarry: as we usually call a g0v project as a hole, maybe "dig" means you used to create a project.

23:03 < slackbot2> <lizbarry> So is it a good thing to "dig a hole"? 
23:04 < slackbot2> <fumi> Very good,and the best thing is to fill the hole.
