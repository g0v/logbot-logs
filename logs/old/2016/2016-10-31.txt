05:52 < slackbot2> <cdmalon> 大家好。Is the raw data from any of your nationwide policy conversations (who submitted what comments, and how the proposals and decisions were formed) available?  I'd like to study the Uber discussions.  All I've found so far is summary presentations, conversation logs (of just a few people), and a few collaborative documents.  If I understand correctly, there should be comments collected from thousands of people.
